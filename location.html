  <p>Camp Washington-Carver is a beautiful retreat listed on the National Register of Historic Places. More than 10,000 people attended events this year at the camp, which serves as the state's mountain cultural arts center. Each season features events chosen to preserve the arts and traditions of yesterday while perpetuating those of today.</p>

    <p> Nearly six years before President Lincoln signed the proclamation making West Virginia the 35th State in the Union, construction had begun on the Wheeling Custom House, headquarters for federal offices for the Western District of Virginia. Its completion, coinciding with the beginning of the Civil War, provided a facility for heated political discussions and constitutional conventions that led to eventual statehood for West Virginia in 1863</p>

    <p>The heart of the site is probably the most famous and certainly the largest of the Adena Burial mounds. A massive undertaking, the total effort required the movement of more than 60,000 tons of earth. Artifacts and exhibits interpreting the lifestyle of the Adena people are displayed in the Delf Norona Museum, adjacent to the 2,000 year old mound. .</p>
